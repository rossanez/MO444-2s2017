Since it hasn't<br>been posted for some time (and I've modified it somewhat since the<br>last time), I'm taking this opportunity to post it.  There is another<br>entry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.  They<br>can be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as<br>pub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.  It contains far<br>more detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, though<br>primarily from a conservative point of view.<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>This posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and<br>Christians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the<br>question each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize<br>the postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes<br>arguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people<br>asking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most<br>common -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is \"how can a<br>Christian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about<br>it?\"<br><br>First, on the definition of 'homosexual'.  Many groups believe that<br>there is a homosexual \"orientation\", i.e. a sexual attraction to<br>members of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual<br>sexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by<br>most groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the<br>term 'homosexual' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.<br>This is generally not accepted outside the most 'liberal' groups.  In<br>this paper I'm going to use 'homosexual' as meaning a person engaging<br>in sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven't heard of any<br>Biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who<br>remains celebate.<br><br>I think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be<br>homosexual.  This is often called a 'homosexual orientation'.  It is<br>not known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence<br>suggesting each.  The best evidence I've seen is that homosexuality is<br>not a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of<br>them is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help<br>people move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is<br>Exodus International\".  The reports I've seen (and I haven't read the<br>detailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the<br>Presbyterian Church's infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that<br>these programs have very low success rates, and that there are<br>questions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly<br>are people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as<br>important as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong<br>believe it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact<br>that it's hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant<br>than the fact that it's hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If<br>it's wrong, it's wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.<br>If it's very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more<br>willing to forgive it.<br><br>One more general background issue: It's common to quote a figure that<br>10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where<br>this came from.  Here's his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source<br>of the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by<br>orientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely<br>heterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,<br>one-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of<br>orgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have<br>most of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The<br>percentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey<br>Institute, based on data in the early seventies but not published<br>until the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can't<br>put my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online<br>information for Kinsey's own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog<br>at Rutgers:<br>   AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.<br>    TITLE Sexual behavior in the human male [by] Alfred C.

A<br>journalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting<br>her book that allegedly refutes Kinsey's study, but the scholarly<br>world seems to take her for a kook......<br><br>I've seen some objections to the Kinsey's study, but not in enough<br>detail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another<br>view, I'd be willing to include it.)<br><br>Most Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.<br>Not all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan<br>Community Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to<br>accept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows<br>it, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal<br>Church seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that<br>have congregational government, you'll find a few congregations that<br>accept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably<br>only one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches<br>permit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is<br>another issue.  I don't have any doubt that there are homosexual<br>pastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.<br><br>As to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here's an<br>attempt to summarize the issues:<br><br>The most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of<br>homosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:<br>\"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality\", U Chicago Press,<br>1980.<br><br>The argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws<br>in the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on<br>homosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some<br>passages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.<br>the sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was<br>homosexual rape, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.<br>(There's even some question whether it was homosexual, since the<br>entities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying<br>because it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in<br>that culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot<br>offered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to<br>allow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance<br>for references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you'll see that few<br>seem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There's a Jewish<br>interpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any<br>rate, there's no debate that homosexual rape is wrong.<br><br>I do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set<br>of laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT<br>justification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.<br><br>The NT references are all in Paul's letters.  A number of the<br>references from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly<br>vague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not<br>mean homosexual.  Here's what he says: The two Greek words that appear<br>in the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and<br>/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words<br>actually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety<br>of metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests<br>\"wanton\" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous<br>interpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was<br>that in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has<br>vanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less<br>frowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the<br>Catholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He<br>translates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none<br>of the church fathers understood the term as referring to<br>homosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the<br>early Latin translations, would be \"active mode homosexual male<br>prostitute\", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.<br><br>For a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee's commentary on I<br>Cor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.<br>However Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not<br>necessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated<br>with some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee<br>say taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very<br>definite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it<br>isn't a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against<br>Boswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a<br>translation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it<br>is that the word is almost never used.  Paul's writing is the first<br>occurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of \"male\" and<br>\"fk\" unfortunately doesn't quite tell us the meaning, since it<br>doesn't tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the<br>action.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.<br>In theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It's dangerous to base<br>meaning purely on etymology, or you'll conclude that \"goodbye\" is a<br>religious expression because it's based on \"God by with ye\".  However<br>since Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on \"homosexual male<br>prostitute\", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this<br>translation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something<br>which Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in<br>their translation).<br><br>In my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans<br>1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something<br>that happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result<br>of their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue<br>that this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false<br>gods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become<br>heterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in<br>fact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is<br>what Paul meant.<br><br>However I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law<br>against homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom<br>1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it's homosexuality that<br>appeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.<br>Despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I'm sure Paul<br>does not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.<br>Given his description of their situation, I rather assume that their<br>heterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do<br>believe that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.<br>But in all fairness, the \"shameless\" nature of their acts is a<br>reflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a<br>specific feature of homosexuality.<br><br>My overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have<br>enough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of<br>homosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are<br>not unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do<br>not seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of<br>homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the<br>other hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the<br>subject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality<br>in passing.<br><br>The result of this situation is that people interpret these passages<br>in light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look<br>to Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising<br>that they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT<br>prohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,<br>it is not surprising that they regard Paul's negative view of<br>homosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing<br>without any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As<br>readers of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these<br>approaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the<br>mouth when they see the opposing view described.  There's not a lot I<br>can do as moderator about such a situation.<br><br>A number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of<br>detailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact<br>I'm not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their<br>own beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the<br>question of whether Paul's judgement should apply to modern<br>homosexuality.<br><br>One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds<br>of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality<br>only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was<br>wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act<br>\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying<br>to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian<br>ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the<br>relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul's<br>judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make<br>judgements on these questions.<br><br>Another is the following: In Paul's time homosexuality was associated<br>with a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It<br>was part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often<br>occured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I'm<br>not in a position to say that it always did, but there are some<br>reasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active<br>and passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult<br>to act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active<br>mode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His<br>customers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This<br>supports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two<br>free adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.<br>Clearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,<br>slaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible<br>partners.  (However Fee's commentary on I Cor cites some examples from<br>ancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve<br>free adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations<br>in this paragraph shouldn't be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have<br>been discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there<br>surely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not<br>involve slaves or children.)<br><br>Some people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against<br>homosexuality.  I'd like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by<br>promiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a<br>homosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is<br>not at risk for AIDS.<br><br>Note that there is good reason from Paul's general approach to doubt<br>that he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,<br>apart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his<br>use of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual<br>marriage as what God ordained.<br><br>However the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning<br>against being too quick to deal with this issue legally.<br><br>I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is<br>not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul's<br>tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating<br>holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues<br>to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to<br>avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.<br>For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat<br>meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about<br>which they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously<br>would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)<br>remain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly<br>would rather see them married than in a state where they might be<br>tempted to fornication.<br><br>I believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the<br>views Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is<br>not what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still<br>conclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the<br>creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This<br>doesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The<br>question is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful<br>or whether you believe that it's a misfortune that is in a broad sense<br>due to human sinfulness.  If you're willing to consider the latter<br>approach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more<br>damage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.<br>The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often<br>fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from<br>psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when<br>attempts at living as a heterosexual fail.<br><br>This is going to depend upon one's assessment of the inherent nature<br>of homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you<br>may be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.<br>Clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency<br>to steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these<br>conditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are<br>intrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for<br>homosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are<br>actually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes<br>AIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual<br>relationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent<br>to Christian heterosexual relationships.)<br><br>In the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we've<br>heard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in<br>this situation.  I've also seen summaries of various research and the<br>results of various efforts for \"conversion\".  (Aside from the<br>Presbyterian report mentioned above, there's an FAQ that summarizes<br>our readers' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that<br>long-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a<br>par with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to<br>depend upon such a change is clear: When \"conversion\" doesn't happen,<br>which is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling<br>excluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement<br>of life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different<br>context) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I<br>think the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that<br>judgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay<br>sex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe<br>homosexuality isn't God's original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul<br>preferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian<br>relationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis<br>suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think such<br>relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love<br>with each other.<br><br>There's an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this<br>discussion.  The issue is that of \"cultural relativism\".  That is,<br>when Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an<br>eternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations<br>in the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist<br>on taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes<br>subjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as<br>relative?<br><br>When looking at this issue, it's worth noting that no one completely<br>rejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of<br>judgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians<br>consider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as<br>clear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:<br><br>  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in<br>\tthe OT -- it's not in the NT, but I mention it here because<br>\tuntil relatively recently the Church did consider it binding<br>\ton Christians)<br>  - prohibition against swearing oaths<br>  - endorsement of slavery as an institution<br>  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner<br><br>We do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the<br>argument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:<br><br>  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific<br>\tagrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,<br>\tbut not to our market economy.<br>  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the<br>\tsame characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was<br>\tconcerned about<br>  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people<br>\thow to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as<br>\tan institution<br>  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to<br>\tRoman tax farming<br><br>The point I'm trying to make is that before applying Biblical<br>prohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th<br>Cent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their<br>relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul<br>would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of<br>argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.<br>Until fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and<br>many Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,<br>slavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship<br>between God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants<br>or slaves of God.)<br><br>I am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally<br>relative.  Rather, I'm trying to say that some things are, and<br>therefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in<br>the Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the<br>action we're talking about now has the same moral implications as the<br>one that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue<br>that there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against<br>homosexuality are still binding, I'm willing to listen.  Those who<br>claim that the question doesn't need to be looked at are kidding<br>themselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey<br>all the rules listed above).<br><br>One thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue<br>creates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --<br>some laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is<br>really idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose<br>words are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among<br>Christians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to<br>people that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.<br>This is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as<br>strongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments<br>as conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I<br>can't help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way<br>of justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a<br>dangerous situation for Christians.<br><br>On the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I<br>have with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.<br>One of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically<br>determined.  I.e. \"God made me homosexual\", and I have no choice.  I<br>think \"God made me homosexual\" is a fine view for people who already<br>believe on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I<br>don't see it as an argument for acceptability.<br><br>Many people think that alcholism is largely biological, and drug<br>addiction may turn out to be as well.  That doesn't mean it's OK.<br>Most of us have particular things we tend to do wrong.  Some people<br>get angry easily.  Others tend to be arrogant.  Others tend to be<br>attraced to women who are married to someone else.  Homosexuality (if<br>we view it as wrong) wouldn't be different than any of these other<br>things.  If we are going to follow God, we all end up at one time or<br>another having to work to overcome bad habits and particular<br>temptations that cause us problems.  None of us can sit back and say<br>that because God made us the way we are we can just relax.  As Jesus<br>said, we all have to take up our cross daily.  This concept of dying<br>to self (which also appears throughout Paul's letters) seems to<br>suggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we<br>are called on not to accept.  Paul's letters and the experience of<br>Christians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us, and<br>the battle against it is lifelong and difficult.  The fact that<br>homosexuality is difficult to fight doesn't necessarily say it's OK.<br>Maybe this isn't the place where we have to die to self.  But I'd like<br>to make sure that those who think it isn't are fighting the battle<br>somewhere else, and not rejecting the concept that all Christians have<br>to fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin.<br></td><td style=\"text-align: left;vertical-align: top; width: 300px; word-break:break-all;\">**eca18ab039421f944ff3e47d7bf485e9267e6e02**<br>Xref: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu soc.religion.christian:21565<br>Path: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu!rochester!rutgers!igor.rutgers.edu!geneva.rutgers.edu!christian<br>From: fortmann@superbowl.und.ac.za (Paul Fortmann - PG)<br>Newsgroups: soc.religion.christian<br>Subject: Praying for Justice<br>Message-ID: &lt;May.13.02.29.51.1993.1514@geneva.rutgers.edu&gt;<br>Date: 13 May 93 06:29:52 GMT<br>Sender: hedrick@geneva.rutgers.edu<br>Organization: University Of Natal (Durban)<br>Lines: 650<br>Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu<br><br>I recently came across this article which I found interesting.

You<br>destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the<br>Lord abhors.\" 5:5-6.<br><br>To those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares:<br>\"Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin\" 52:5;<br>\"Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who<br>go on in their sins\" 68:21.<br><br>And the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: \"Then<br>it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ...\"<br>59:13; \"to proclaim the powers of God\" 68:34; \"All kings will bow<br>down to Him and all nations will serve Him \" 72:11; \"Who knows<br>the power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fear<br>that is due You. \" 90:11<br><br>Yet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include<br>imprecations (prayers invoking God's righteous judgement upon the<br>wicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church.<br>However, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much<br>more common.<br><br><br>PRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS<br><br>Amidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I<br>found the survivors of communist persecution including the<br>crippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God to<br>strike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church.<br>I was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heaven<br>pray \"How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge<br>the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?\" Revelation<br>6:10).<br><br>The initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino<br>Neto. Described as a \"drunken, psychotic, marxist poet\", Neto had<br>been installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola.<br>He boasted that: \"Within 20 years there won't be a Bible or a<br>church left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity.\" Yet<br>despite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is<br>not Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto.<br>Neto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in<br>Moscow.<br><br>In Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded<br>of God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer:<br>    A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be<br>     arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.<br>    Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles<br>     in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be<br>     turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in<br>     fact carried out. But the next day when the official was<br>     medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal<br>     cancer. He died shortly afterwards.<br>    On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a<br>     Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car<br>     crash the very next day.<br>    When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on<br>     the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to<br>     carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted<br>     gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation,<br>     the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to<br>     dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded<br>     with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would<br>     not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against<br>     Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building<br>     was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship.<br>     \"They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord<br>     Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the<br>     Lord spread widely and grew in power. \" Acts 19:17,20<br><br>Nicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the<br>persecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and<br>executed on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of \"the<br>antiChrist is dead\" in the streets. Many testified that this was<br>in answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of<br>Romania.<br><br>Another persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora<br>Machel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machel<br>was a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in<br>the 1960's. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would<br>destroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly<br>Marxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches in<br>Mozambique were closed confiscated, \"nationalised\" chained and<br>padlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled,<br>some being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibles<br>were ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians,<br>including many pastors and elders, were shipped off to<br>concentration camps - most were never seen again.<br><br>A month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly<br>and challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him<br>(Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches were<br>specifically praying for God to stop the persecution in<br>Mozambique, Machel's Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent<br>thunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa's<br>boundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans<br>for overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and<br>published. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor,<br>but He had also saved a country from persecution.<br><br>In the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in<br>Zambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27<br>year socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on<br>31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted to<br>Christ whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was elected<br>president of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian<br>country.<br><br>It is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots,<br>declared trembling and in tears: \"I am more afraid of John Knox's<br>prayers than of an army of ten thousand\".<br><br>On 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African<br>Communist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedented<br>international wave of condolences and adulation reported one<br>could be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a<br>martyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ<br>Jesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa<br>this Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani.<br><br>The stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people<br>were murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collective<br>concern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of<br>the SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other<br>victims. Indeed the SA government, the international community<br>and the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported<br>over this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans<br>murdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC were<br>unbanned!<br><br>Yet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973,<br>Deputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANC's \"military<br>wing\" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hani<br>had approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many<br>unarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: \"all who live by the sword<br>will die by the sword \" Matt 26:52.<br><br>After personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities<br>at a press conference in Washington DC (where he publicly<br>declared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, Yasser<br>Arafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs<br>and limpet mines in public places during \"the struggle\") I told<br>him that I was a Christian and, while I didn't hate him, I did<br>hate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either<br>bring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that God<br>would remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that he<br>was an atheist.<br><br>Several other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani<br>to repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches in<br>America have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against<br>unrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struck<br>down, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer,<br>within months of these public prayers for God to stop these<br>killers of preborn babies.<br><br>Some praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted:<br>\"When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror<br>to evildoers \" Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that any<br>Christian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any -<br>even of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory<br>prayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so did<br>our Lord (Matt 11:20-24).<br><br>What then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be?<br>Should we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues I<br>would like to present a short summary of an excellent book, \"War<br>Psalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory<br>Psalms\" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian and<br>Reformed Publishing Company):<br><br>Our Lord Jesus Christ &amp; His apostles used the Psalms constantly<br>in teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes the<br>Old Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NT<br>are from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50<br>times. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.<br><br><br>1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God?<br><br>Some Christian commentators &amp; theologians reject these Psalms as<br>\"devilish\", \"diabolical \", \"unsuited to the church\", and \"Not God<br>'s pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of<br>a man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus'<br>teaching that we should love our enemies. \"<br><br>Yet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares:<br>\"All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching,<br>rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the<br>man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. \"<br>(see also 2 Peter 3:15-16).<br><br>The fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our<br>comprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its<br>inspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil<br>is to impudently take the place of God.<br><br>Do we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of God<br>have led many to become \"evangelic plastic surgeons who have made<br>it their job to \"clean up\" God's Word according to their own<br>ideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alone<br>who must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for<br>His Church. The essence of what many have done is to question the<br>authority of God's Word (like Eve's original sin of listening to<br>Satan's question \"Yes, hath God said... ?\").<br><br>The Psalms are part of God's revelation of Himself and His<br>attributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the<br>authoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which these<br>evangelical plastic surgeons reject as \"unsuited\" and \"unworthy\"<br>for the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about<br>Himself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostles<br>used as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb<br>4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2.<br><br>CH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especially<br>Ps 109):<br>\"Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage<br>which the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in<br>judgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord would<br>speak to us therein. \"<br><br>The rejection of any part of God's Word is a rejection of the<br>giver of that Word, God Himself.<br><br><br>2. Who is praying these Psalms?<br><br>Christ quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actually<br>spoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied an<br>enormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayer<br>book and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at<br>the Last Supper.<br><br>On the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient<br>authority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very own<br>words - the words of the Lord's Anointed - which as David's Son<br>He truly was.<br>\"Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit\" Ps 31:5<br>\"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" Ps 22:1<br><br>In His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on<br>the day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so!<br>Matt 7:23 \"Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away<br>from me, you evildoers'. \" Ps 6:8<br><br>In Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ<br>although nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said<br>these words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22<br>directly to Christ despite there being no record of His having<br>spoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believed<br>Christ is speaking in the Psalms.<br><br>Christ came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in<br>all the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come again<br>to execute Judgement on the wicked.<br>David as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a<br>prototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30:<br>\"being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the<br>resurrection of Christ. \"<br>David was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and in<br>his words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiah<br>spoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also by<br>Christ. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His<br>forerunner David.<br><br>The imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of<br>God, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassion<br>for the wronged.<br><br><br>3. But what about the Psalms of repentance?<br><br>Christ is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice for<br>our sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with<br>the sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts for<br>which He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was the<br>substitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah<br>53).<br><br>\"God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we<br>might become the righteousness of God. \" 2 Cor 5:21<br><br>In history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, have<br>been understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: St<br>Augustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others.<br>All the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying the<br>imprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the Lord<br>Jesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It is<br>only right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy<br>His enemies.<br><br>These prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of<br>King Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God's Word is revealed<br>upon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God's way of<br>forgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses<br>of God.<br><br>He who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a<br>reality when He declares to those on His left:<br>\"Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared<br>for the devil and his angels. \" Matt 25:41<br><br>All the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. God's<br>Kingdom is at War. The powers of evil will tall and God alone<br>will reign forever!<br>\"With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes a<br>sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule<br>them with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury of<br>the wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. \"<br>Rev 19 : 15<br><br><br>4. Are Jesus' prayers contradictory?<br><br>What about Jesus' command to love our enemies and to bless those<br>who curse us (Matt 5:44)?<br><br>Christ is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives<br>sin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement<br>on those who disobey His Gospel.<br><br>\"God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you<br>and give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen when<br>the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His<br>powerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel<br>of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting<br>destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from<br>the majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in<br>His holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have<br>believed. \" 2 Thess 1:6-10<br><br>Jesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power on<br>earth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we see<br>both the vengeance and the love ot God.<br><br>Even in the N.T. &amp; in the Gospels we see imprecations.<br>\"Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of<br>greed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! You<br>brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? \"<br>Matt 23<br><br>In Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His<br>betrayal by Judas.<br><br>We also need to acknowledge that Christ's prayers of blessing are<br>not for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only<br>praying to the elect of God - those who have:<br>\"obeyed your Word\"... \"accepted\" God's Word ... and have<br>\"believed \". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the<br>message of God's kingdom will be judged.)<br><br><br>5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms?<br><br>Martin Luther pointed out that when one prays: \"Hallowed be Thy<br>Name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done \" then \"he must put all<br>the opposition to this in one pile and say: 'Curses, maledictions<br>and disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. May<br>they be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and<br>wisdom and plans run aground' . \"<br><br>To pray tor the extension of God's kingdom is to solicit the<br>destruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: \"The God of<br>heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it<br>will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it<br>will itself endure forever. \"<br><br> Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for<br>the kingdom of darkness. <br><br>There is a life &amp; death struggle between two kingdoms. The Church<br>cannot exclude hatred tor satan's kingdom from its love for God's<br>kingdom. God's kingdom cannot come without satan's kingdom being<br>destroyed. God's will cannot be done on earth without the<br>destruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction of<br>evil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism<br>which insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights<br>of man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God.<br><br>Note Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who \"plot<br>together\" against God and His people:<br>\"Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O<br>Lord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and<br>Jabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like<br>refuse on the ground. \"<br><br>The story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5)<br>provides a vivid example of God's judgement on the wicked. Sisera<br>\"cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years\" and they<br>\"cried to the Lord for help\" Judges 4:3. In response to those<br>prayers: \"The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by<br>the sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot...<br>All the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. \"<br>Judges 4:15-16<br><br>The account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the<br>tent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety<br>and then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. The<br>song of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of<br>the head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it is<br>this that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. \"As<br>you did to Sisera ...\"<br><br><br>6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience<br><br>The imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God:<br>     \"If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law,<br>     which are written in this book, and do not revere this<br>     glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord<br>     will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He<br>     will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you<br>     dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also<br>     bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not<br>     recorded in this Book of the Law until you are<br>     destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ...<br>     so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be<br>     uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. \"<br>     Deuteronomy 28:58-63<br><br>The covenant God made with His people included curses for<br>disobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27<br>records the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in<br>an awesome account:<br>\"The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud<br>voice:<br>\"Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing<br>detestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman's hands - and<br>sets it up in secret. \"<br>Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \"<br>\"Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother...<br>\"Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour's boundary stone...<br>\"Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads...<br>\"Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the<br>fatherless or the widow...<br>\"Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly...<br>\"Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent<br>person.<br>\"Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by<br>carrying them out.<br>Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \" Deut 27:14-26<br><br>The New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of<br>rejecting Christ is the curse. \"If anyone does not love the<br>Lord - a curse be on him. \" 1 Corinthians 16:22<br><br>(See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26-<br>31; 12:14-29.)<br><br><br>7. How can we preach these prayers?<br><br>The Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders.<br>Scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander-<br>in-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass on<br>those orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can we<br>expect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that the<br>troops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the<br>strongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does not<br>hear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Him<br>onto the battlefield?<br><br>Pastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church's<br>Commander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose job<br>is to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain<br>and severe punishment if he dared to amend the general's orders.<br>The pastor's charge is of greater importance than that of a<br>courier in any earthly army. There's no place tor the dispatcher<br>to decide he doesn't agree with his Commander's strategy.<br><br>When Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching<br>mission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God's Kingdom (Lk<br>10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to God's<br>rule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on<br>any house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected<br>it, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But we<br>must consider what He said they should do if their message were<br>rejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against<br>God's rule - \"But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go<br>into its 'streets and say, 'Even the dust of your town that<br>sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this:<br>The kingdom of God is near\"' Luke 10:11.<br><br>What would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, it<br>will be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sent<br>fire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that<br>town (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin,<br>Bethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message<br>(verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the great<br>authority He had given them: \"He who listens to you listens to<br>Me; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejects<br>him who sent Me \" (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis tor<br>calling down God's curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion<br>against God's authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of<br>His servants.<br><br>We need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the<br>Prince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from its<br>lethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass on<br>the battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks<br>will be inevitable.<br><br>Like Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of<br>obedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth is<br>that God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall he<br>reap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience in<br>Deut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings<br>6:2&amp;29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenant<br>breakers is real.<br><br>The \"I\" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The \"we\" of the Psalms<br>includes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not our<br>own, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. The<br>Psalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They record<br>Christ's march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. As<br>Christ is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the final<br>fulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God will<br>answer the psalmist's prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the<br>final day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day when<br>He will say: \"But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be<br>King over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me\"<br>Luke 19:27.<br><br>A fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to<br>obey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these war<br>psalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God's<br>kingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by<br>the kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each local<br>congregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally your<br>battalion to put on the whole armour of God, including \"the sword<br>of the Spirit, which is the Word of God \" Eph 6:17. That battle-<br>readiness also involves \"pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasions<br>with all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18.<br><br>Christ teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the<br>enemies of God as the psalmist did: \"Pour out Your wrath on the<br>nations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not<br>call on Your Name\" Ps 79:6.<br><br>To deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it<br>is necessary for us to pray for God's justice. Those who are<br>persecuted need the comfort of these prayers.<br><br>\"Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May the<br>praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in<br>their hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment<br>on the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles<br>with shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against<br>them. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. \" Ps<br>149:5-9<br><br>Prayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare.

It<br>was a pleasure to read them.\"<br> <br>MY REPLY...<br>You are welcome, Zane.<br> <br>Zane...<br>\"I am sure nothing that I will say will change your mind about it... but I<br>would like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you.<br>I mean, were you all caught up in the word/faith thing, but now that you<br>have read the book you've been rescued from all of the error and pain that<br>will result in your Christian life?\"<br> <br>MY REPLY...<br>(1) When I first became a Christian, I entered into the Word/Faith<br>    movement.  It was easy.  I wasn't grounded in the Word of God and sound<br>    doctrine.  When I visited Christian book stores, the cheapest books I<br>    could find to buy were the .50 and 1.00 books by Hagin and others.<br>    Consequently, I began receiving Hagin's monthly magazine (and they<br>    still send it to me), and also Copeland's (also, still sent to me).<br>    It wasn't until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called _Hyper Faith:<br>    The New Gnosticism_ that I began to realize the teachings I were<br>    partaking of were error.  I started reading the Bible more and studying<br>    more.  Sure enough, Jimmy was right in many points.  As part of my<br>    experience, I am alerting Christians, particularly new Christians, that<br>    these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in<br>    Acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with Scripture!<br> <br>(2) My brother in law was involved in a Word/Faith \"cult\" in my area - it's<br>    leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn.  Rather then going into<br>    much detail about this, suffice it to say he was deceived, mistreated, and<br>    has now fallen into atheism.  I'm still praying for him (Phil. 1:6).<br> <br>(3) The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been<br>    a `follower' of Copeland for 15 years.  He has thousands of tapes by the<br>    Faith teachers.  In the class recently, I quoted several of the teachers'<br>    heretical statements to his surprise.  Since then, I've been able to talk<br>    to him at length about these issues.<br> <br>(4) The leader of the Women's Group at my church is a Benny Hinn `fan'.<br>    Recently, I found that she has been lending _Good Morning, Holy Spirit_ to<br>    women in the church.  That prompted my quotes in Sunday School, as well as<br>    my lending CIC to people in the church.<br> <br>I'm well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and<br>have an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies.<br>What heresies?<br>    A. Jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil, and became<br>        one with him.<br>    B. Jesus' death on the cross wasn't enough to atone.<br>    C. Jesus was dragged to hell after His death, was beat and abused by<br>        Satan and demons, thus finishing our atonement.  Satan was ruling<br>        over Him there.<br>    D. Jesus was `born-again' in hell.<br>    E. Jesus died spiritually, lost His divinity, and reassumed it after<br>        the resurrection.<br>    F. We are gods.<br> <br>These are heresies.  Documentation will be provided re: these teachings<br>upon request.<br> <br>Zane...<br>\"Or what does it do for you?  Is it preventing you from going out and<br>joining up with the word/faith movement which you'd been contemplating<br>joining for so long, but now that you've read the book, you've been saved<br>from all of that?\"<br> <br>MY REPLY...<br>It wasn't _Christianity In Crisis_ that helped me; it was a booklet by<br>Swaggart that I mentioned above.  But CIC is MUCH, MUCH better - tremendous<br>documentation and insights.<br> <br>Zane...<br>\"I don't have a nice Scriptural answer for why I believe it is at best un-<br>profitable for Christians to engage in this type of activity - heresy hunting.\"<br> <br>MY REPLY...<br>Why do you call it \"heresy hunting\"?  \"Hunting\" implies it isn't readily<br>accessible or available.  This movement is the fastest growing movement in<br>Christendom.  Hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets.  Hinn has sold<br>more books in the last couple of years than Swindoll and Dobson combined.  Fred<br>Price has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the USA.  Doesn't<br>sound like much \"hunting\" is needed.<br> <br>It is Scriptural to expose doctrinal error.  I gave some verses to you before.<br>More can be given.  Most of the epistles were written due to error (doctrinal,<br>practical) in the churches.  The early church had numerous councils to expose<br>error and heresy.  It's not a new thing.  Remember Luther?<br> <br>Zane...<br>\"I would like to point out though, that historically those who hunt heretics<br>often end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics... but this is my un-<br>documented opinion.\"<br> <br>MY REPLY...<br>(1) If you can provide documentation, it would be appreciated.<br>(2) Read Ephesians 4:11-16, esp. vss. 13 and 14 and tell me what causes<br>    disunity and immaturity in the body.<br> <br>EPH 4:13-14 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of<br>the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness<br>of Christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried<br>about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning<br>craftiness of deceitful plotting....<br> <br>Disunity, contrary to popular opinion, isn't caused by exposing error; it's<br>caused by error.<br> <br>Zane...<br>\"There are many who probably give no place for seeing the Scriptures as<br>documenting a Spiritual development or growth in its writers - but I would<br>suggest that the fiery Paul of the letter to the Galatians mellows and<br>matures into the one who loses all for the sake of Love in the End.\"<br> <br>MY REPLY...<br>Most scholars believe Paul wrote 2 Timothy last.

Unfortunately, heresy is being<br>taught not just in Copeland's church or Hagin's or Hinn's or Price's, but all<br>over the radio, in print, etc.  No pastor or church leader knows what materials<br>the sheep are feeding on outside the church.  It's imperative that leadership<br>be made aware of this, and CIC does just that.<br> <br>Also, let's examine a passage of Scripture...<br> EPH 4:11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some<br>evangelists, and some pastors and teachers,<br> EPH 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the<br>edifying of the body of Christ,<br> <br>These ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for one<br>individual church, but for \"the body of Christ\".<br>Paul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message.

This, I believe will not occur fully until the Lord Jesus returns (see<br>1Cor. 13:9-12).  But God wants the body to continue on maturing.  What hinders<br>maturity and unity of the body?<br> <br> EPH 4:14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried<br>about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning<br>craftiness of deceitful plotting,<br> <br>It's clear that false doctrine, integrated into the church \"by the trickery of<br>men\" causes (1) disunity [the thing we are striving for] and (2) spiritual<br>immaturity - the church continues in spiritual childhood when Christians are<br>\"tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine\".<br> <br>The \"Five -Fold\" ministry, of which there does not appear to be clear<br>Scriptural denominational boundaries (\"pastors\" appear responsible for their<br>individual flock), is to deal with these doctrines (when necessary) in their<br>struggle to equip the body.<br> <br>All believers are called to do this to a degree...<br>JUD 1:3-4 Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our<br>common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend<br>earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.

There are<br>verifiable, previous examples of levels of U.S. governments<br>abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid<br>to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused<br>in thye future.

But as long as the politicians grab power to sell<br>pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.  <br><br>       It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust<br>the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed<br>to do it, then we should change governments.

I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.<br><br>&gt;Guns 'n Criminals:<br>&gt;MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen.<br><br>       This is very likely.<br><br>&gt;Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control.<br>&gt;And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe),<br>&gt;we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.<br><br>       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many<br>people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're<br>here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is<br>necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should<br>have always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't.<br>Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more<br>magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more<br>heavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.<br><br>&gt;Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:<br>&gt;What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!<br><br>       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,<br>two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide<br>rates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about<br>half the per-car death rate.<br><br>&gt;The issue (I hope..):<br>&gt;I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.<br>&gt;Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??)<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)Jugoslavia:<br>&gt;They should all have weapons, it's their rigth to have them, and if they use them<br>&gt;to kill other (Innocent) people the problem is humans, not guns.<br><br>      The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The<br>fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,<br>whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally<br>irrelevent.<br><br>      Yet weapons are built.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous<br>impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.<br><br>      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt<br>to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even<br>if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.<br><br>&gt;If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them<br>&gt;or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,<br>&gt;it's the 'axer' ??<br>&gt;(An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)<br><br><br>       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.<br>(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per <br>se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's<br>countries entire violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got<br>more knives or fists.  <br><br>       In any case, I think examples of gun control applied to the U.S.<br>have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms<br>of prohibition.  Until you deal with why people are doing what they<br>are doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is <br>violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The<br>vast majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of<br>99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that<br>you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.<br><br>&gt;Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect<br>&gt;themselves. Is this a good situation ?? <br><br>       The situation is not \"good\" in that people fear for their lives.<br>But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,<br>protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,<br>too, lost their livelihoods?<br><br>&gt;Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??<br><br>       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't.<br>However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can<br>be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition<br>won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.<br><br>       You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If<br>you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is<br>a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully<br>simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough,<br>as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)<br><br>&gt;If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have<br>&gt;guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)<br><br>       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.<br>That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.<br>Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the<br>group least likely to be involved in violent crime.<br><br>       You may take that for what it's worth.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

I understand getting one is far more difficult<br>there than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke. <br><br>       But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different<br>things.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit<br>to operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary<br>to own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the<br>ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise<br>from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations<br>for behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,<br>which is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get<br>past legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public<br>property, but in restricting activity on private property.              <br><br>&gt;Use of guns in crimes (in Norway):<br>&gt;Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms'<br>&gt;for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.<br>&gt;Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short <br>&gt;time befor the crime.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Use of knives:<br>&gt;It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'.<br>&gt;You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open<br>&gt;in public -rigth ??<br><br>        This varies widely.  (One thing I think Europeans have<br>a difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,<br>where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different<br>as from one country in Europe to another).<br><br>        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow<br>concealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can<br>be either a state or local restriciton.       <br><br>&gt;Individual vs masses:<br>&gt;Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some<br>&gt;extent....<br>&gt;Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??<br>&gt;What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of <br>&gt;all the others ??<br><br>       The question must be asked:  Is the right of this individual<br>affecting the rights of this other individual.  What we usually<br>get is that the rights of this group (meaning some individuals within<br>this group, here defined as \"people who own guns,\") are adversely affecting <br>the rights of some other group.  <br><br>       If for instance, \"Bob\" were using his gun to attack \"Steve,\" you'd<br>have a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase<br>some person who qualifies as a member of the group \"people who own<br>guns\" then some third person, perhaps in another time zone is told<br>that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's<br>rights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited<br>by one.<br><br>&gt;The issue:<br>&gt;I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.<br><br>       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to<br>what extent guns and gun legislation impact those.<br><br>&gt;We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....<br>&gt;IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.<br>&gt;But should it have to be like that ??<br><br>       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that<br>other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.<br>But currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.<br><br>&gt;Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??<br><br>       No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state<br>may enforce it's \"wisdom\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise<br>concept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be<br>\"unwise\" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.<br>   <br>&gt;If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think<br>&gt;it should be free to buy guns ??<br><br>       I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently<br>implemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue<br>generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of<br>drivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is<br>necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody<br>else killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year<br>old will have picked up riding around in his parents car.<br><br>       But, as I mentioned, they're two different things.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Image annotation software<br>=============================<br><br>a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.

I'm not<br>  sure exactly what they are.<br>  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.<br><br>c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)<br>  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats<br>  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert<br>  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.<br>  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu<br>  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)<br><br>d.

This was<br>  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working<br>  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL<br>  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I<br>  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general<br>  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.<br>  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose<br>  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I<br>  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh<br>  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image<br>  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've<br>  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best<br>  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large<br>  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a<br>  freebie if you want it\"<br><br>  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,<br>  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its<br>  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It<br>  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing<br>  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even<br>  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH<br>  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which<br>  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use<br>  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical<br>  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,<br>  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image<br>  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity<br>  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve<br>  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"<br><br>[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and<br> for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

It is a popular geographic and<br>  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a<br>  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,<br>  although it is reported to have significant image processing<br>  capabilities.<br><br>  Feature Descriptions<br><br>  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the<br>  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source<br>  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass<br>  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using<br>  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who<br>  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very<br>  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of<br>  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel<br>  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose<br>  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in<br>  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the<br>  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric<br>  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective<br>  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus<br>  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps.

GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC<br>  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,<br>  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster<br>  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it<br>  easy to use.

Imager is basically an  image processing package with a<br>  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.<br><br>  Feature Description<br><br>  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.<br>  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a<br>  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).<br>  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.<br>  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering<br>  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,<br>  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages<br>  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band<br>  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.<br><br>  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle<br>  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available<br>  for GIS applications.<br>  Host Configuration Requirements<br><br>  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)<br>  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software<br>  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.<br><br>PCI<br>---<br>  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes<br>  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of<br>  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"<br>  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I<br>  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix<br>  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly<br>  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.<br><br>  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of<br>  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI<br>  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility<br>  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape<br>  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;<br>  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can<br>  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several<br>  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap<br>  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type<br>  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically<br>  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and<br>  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.<br>  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and<br>  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't<br>  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your<br>  particular application/interest calls for.<br><br>  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from<br>  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default<br>  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same<br>  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting<br>  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a<br>  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to<br>  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,<br>  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also<br>  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's<br>  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled<br>  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI<br>  data structures (database file, parameter file).<br><br>  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but<br>  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the<br>  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle<br>  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a<br>  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the<br>  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different<br>  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the<br>  graphic-arts industry's \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)<br>  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT<br>  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start<br>  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to<br>  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map<br>  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of<br>  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often<br>  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,<br>  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this<br>  can go into the PCI \"database\").<br><br>  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX<br>  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific<br>  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to<br>  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would<br>  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus<br>  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"<br>  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"<br>  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice<br>  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's<br>  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which<br>  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe<br>  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these<br>  areas.<br><br>SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)<br>--------------------------------<br>  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis<br>  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed<br>  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, &lt;= 256 pixels<br>  across by &lt;= 512 lines by &lt;= 256 bands); a modified version has since<br>  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging<br>  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.<br><br>  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and<br>  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).<br>  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement<br>  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.<br><br>  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may<br>  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame<br>  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X<br>  for display.<br><br>MAP II<br>------<br>  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.<br><br>CLRview<br>-------<br>  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit<br>  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.<br><br>  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the<br>  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

This was<br>  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working<br>  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL<br>  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I<br>  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general<br>  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.<br>  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose<br>  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I<br>  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh<br>  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image<br>  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've<br>  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best<br>  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large<br>  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a<br>  freebie if you want it\"<br><br>  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,<br>  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its<br>  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It<br>  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing<br>  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even<br>  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH<br>  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which<br>  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use<br>  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical<br>  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,<br>  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image<br>  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity<br>  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve<br>  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"<br><br>[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and<br> for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets <br>  comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, <br>  menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability <br>  of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an <br>  encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap <br>  manipulation, image display, and contour plotting.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)<br>===================================================<br><br>GRASS<br>-----<br>  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army<br>  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and<br>  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a<br>  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,<br>  although it is reported to have significant image processing<br>  capabilities.<br><br>  Feature Descriptions<br><br>  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the<br>  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source<br>  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass<br>  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using<br>  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who<br>  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very<br>  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of<br>  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel<br>  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose<br>  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in<br>  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the<br>  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric<br>  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective<br>  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus<br>  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps.

GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC<br>  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,<br>  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster<br>  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it<br>  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented<br>  in raster (grid-cell) form.<br><br>  Availability<br><br>  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:<br>  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).<br><br>  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to<br>  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.<br><br>  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as<br>  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.<br>  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and<br>  \"tar\" archiving of files.

The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix<br>  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly<br>  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.<br><br>  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of<br>  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI<br>  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility<br>  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape<br>  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;<br>  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can<br>  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several<br>  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap<br>  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type<br>  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically<br>  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and<br>  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.<br>  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and<br>  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't<br>  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your<br>  particular application/interest calls for.<br><br>  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from<br>  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default<br>  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same<br>  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting<br>  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a<br>  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to<br>  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,<br>  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also<br>  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's<br>  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled<br>  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI<br>  data structures (database file, parameter file).<br><br>  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but<br>  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the<br>  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle<br>  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a<br>  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the<br>  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different<br>  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the<br>  graphic-arts industry's \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)<br>  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT<br>  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start<br>  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to<br>  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map<br>  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of<br>  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often<br>  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,<br>  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this<br>  can go into the PCI \"database\").<br><br>  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX<br>  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific<br>  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to<br>  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would<br>  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus<br>  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"<br>  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"<br>  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice<br>  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's<br>  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which<br>  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe<br>  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these<br>  areas.<br><br>SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)<br>--------------------------------<br>  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis<br>  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed<br>  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, &lt;= 256 pixels<br>  across by &lt;= 512 lines by &lt;= 256 bands); a modified version has since<br>  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging<br>  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.<br><br>  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and<br>  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).<br>  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement<br>  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.<br><br>  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may<br>  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame<br>  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.

All of the packages mentioned can do<br>some form of gray to b&amp;w conversion.<br><br><br>6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.<br><br>The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source<br>image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.<br>This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,<br>loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the reverse<br>transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.<br>This method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one<br>2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing<br>sub-pixel sampling.<br><br>However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,<br>which involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally<br>created for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is<br>also present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: \"A Fast Algorithm for Raster<br>Rotation\", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics<br>Interface '86 (Vancouver).

Despite the name, it can contain not only images<br>but other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and<br>information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.<br><br><br><br>9) Converting between vector formats.<br><br>A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw<br>to CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very<br>different problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting<br>one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you<br>get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects<br>are the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.<br>The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled<br>round-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.<br>Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do<br>a one-to-one conversion between vector formats.<br><br>There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The<br>contributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.<br>A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.<br><br>On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,<br>rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.<br>As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such<br>converters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been<br>posted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive<br>site.<br><br>A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format<br>to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to<br>X11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for<br>PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,<br>the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11/NeWs can<br>be used to render to a file if you're clever.  But in general, the<br>answer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to<br>vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be<br>trivial.<br><br>GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes<br>drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as<br>a PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements<br>essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript<br>and level 2).<br><br><br>10) How to get Pixar films.<br><br>The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available<br>on video tape.

The approximation may look acceptable,<br>but it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of<br>approximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not<br>visible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to<br>do the job right, consult the article:<br><br>  \"A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles\"<br>  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller<br>  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,<br>  September, 1989, pages 48-56.<br><br>For rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:<br><br>  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture<br>  by I.

ANSI can let<br>you know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering<br>at 1-800-854-7179.<br><br><br>13) How to FTP by email.<br><br>There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups<br>and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message<br>to an automated server saying something like \"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\",<br>and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.<br><br>In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to<br>ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying \"help\" and it will tell you how to use<br>it.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.<br><br><br>14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.<br><br>Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to<br>infinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,<br>the point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of<br>edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior<br>hole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in<br>the trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article in<br>Glassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including<br>treatment of special cases.<br><br>Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all<br>the vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,<br>if the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an<br>order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the<br>trigonometric functions is usually quite costly.<br><br>Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in<br>the Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:<br>pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.<br><br><br>15) How to tessellate a sphere.<br><br>One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The<br>base of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides<br>each triangle into four smaller ones.

INTRODUCTION <br><br>In this issue of the Newsletter, we learn of the CDC's announced concern for<br>the \"resurgence of infectious diseases\" in the United States.  Thanks to<br>Jonathan Lord for sending me the UPI release.  The CDC announced they would<br>feature a new series of articles in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly<br>Report on these infectious diseases (LD is one of them).  We will keep you<br>up to date on this series.<br><br>In addition, we feature a The Wall Street Journal article on the legal issues<br>surrounding LD.  We also look at Lyme's effects from the perspective of<br>urologists in an abstract entitled \"Urinary Dysfunction in Lyme Disease.\"<br><br>Finally, Terry Morse asks an intriguing question about a tick's habitat.<br><br>-Marc.<br><br><br>II.

NEWS FROM THE WIRES <br><br>Sender: Jonathan Lord &lt;jml4s@uva.pcmail.virginia.edu&gt;<br>Subject: RESURGENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONCERNS CDC<br>Date: Thursday April 15, 1993<br><br>ATLANTA (UPI) --   A resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly<br>emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation's<br>health care system, federal health officials said Thursday.<br><br>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reporting its latest<br>findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that<br>sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four, said it will<br>put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases.<br><br>Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled \"Emerging<br>Infectious Diseases\" to be featured in the CDC's Morbidity &amp; Mortality<br>Weekly Report, which has a wide circulation in the health community.<br>The issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific<br>counselors to update the CDC's draft plan for dealing with the growing<br>threat of infectious ailments.<br><br>\"This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility<br>to deal with it,\" said Dr. Ruth Berkelman, deputy director of the CDC's<br>National Center for Infectious Diseases.<br><br>There were more cases of malaria in the U.S. in 1992 than in any year<br>since the 1960s, and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic,<br>the first in this century, she said.<br><br>Resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem.<br>\"We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past\"<br>Berkleman said.

The decision last week has put property owners<br>on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from<br>the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if<br>someone becomes infected while on the property.<br><br>The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came<br>after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the<br>Long Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the<br>disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered<br>the New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than<br>560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical<br>expenses and lost wages.<br><br>Summer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or<br>semirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the<br>groups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.<br>Kass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass &amp; Case, who wrote a<br>legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential<br>liability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard<br>barbecue might be potentially liable.<br><br>Lawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summer<br>vacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home<br>she rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky<br>Mountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered<br>an outdoor restaurant to pay more than 3 million to a patron who was<br>stung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent<br>quadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence<br>that a beehive was near the restaurant.<br><br>But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the<br>country -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic<br>states, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this<br>particular insect bite a particularly litigious one.<br><br>The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the<br>courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will<br>cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not<br>diagnosing the disease.<br><br>Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease<br>have become common in some states in recent years. Payments in<br>worker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and<br>lost earnings.<br><br>The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more<br>lucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of<br>negligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing<br>injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a<br>result, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property<br>owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many<br>other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the<br>disease.<br><br>Ira M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &amp;<br>Maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help<br>to establish \"the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect<br>against Lyme disease.\"<br><br>Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning a<br>lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For<br>one thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when<br>and where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs<br>in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned<br>by the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.<br>The workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to<br>the insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded<br>some work sites.<br><br>A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that<br>the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is<br>considering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding<br>that it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says<br>the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special<br>pants to protect against bug bites.<br><br>Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up<br>some legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a<br>victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.<br>Earlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association<br>reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.<br>And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical<br>disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.<br><br>Because of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies<br>already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease.

But had<br>forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.<br>I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've<br>found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources<br>that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some<br>pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much<br>worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past<br>(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due<br>to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced<br>the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately<br>after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the<br>only \"real solution\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have<br>any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and<br>one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had<br>the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested<br>I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks<br>that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan<br>to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out<br>the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something<br>similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me<br>horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In<br>fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take<br>it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both <br>legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until<br>I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes<br>several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective<br>at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime<br>I'm frequently in severe pain.<br><br>The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in<br>bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs<br>(I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with<br>nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to<br>what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have<br>several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)<br>it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan<br>was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others<br>hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.<br>The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation<br>compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,<br>called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the<br>\"internal nerves\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that<br>I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain<br>is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,<br>I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain<br>to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9<br>months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd <br>always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,<br>and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical<br>therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month<br>or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,<br>but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at<br>a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going<br>away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which<br>could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have<br>nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off<br>traction about 2 weeks ago.<br><br>Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid<br>taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because<br>I have other pain sources, that \"force\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot<br>to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,<br>but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,<br>occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at<br>a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading<br>and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much,<br>I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because<br>the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can<br>cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric<br>shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad<br>I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home<br>and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the<br>migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot<br>of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.<br>I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so<br>I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take<br>more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will<br>eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when<br>I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan<br>becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications<br>(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but<br>they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do?<br>My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the<br>pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of<br>pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped<br>once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the<br>succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.<br><br>Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute<br>to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.<br><br>Janice Rathmann<br><br></td><td style=\"text-align: left;vertical-align: top; width: 300px; word-break:break-all;\">**51f66e88c690adc887c2fa06ff610c2e07f63f29**<br>Newsgroups: sci.med<br>Path: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu!crabapple.srv.cs.cmu.edu!fs7.ece.cmu.edu!europa.eng.gtefsd.com!darwin.sura.net!sgiblab!sdd.hp.com!decwrl!decwrl!uunet!utcsri!utnut!utzoo!telly!problem!intacc!bed<br>From: bed@intacc.uucp (Deb Waddington)<br>Subject: INFO NEEDED: Gaucher's Disease<br>Message-ID: &lt;1993Mar18.002149.1111@intacc.uucp&gt;<br>Date: Thu, 18 Mar 1993 00:21:49 GMT<br>Distribution: Everywhere<br>Expires: 01 Jun 93<br>Reply-To: bed@intacc.UUCP (Deb Waddington)<br>Organization: Matrix Artists' Network<br>Lines: 33<br><br><br>I have a 42 yr old male friend, misdiagnosed as having<br> osteopporosis for two years, who recently found out that his<br> illness is the rare Gaucher's disease. <br><br>Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9 <br> inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal<br> bleeding; and fatigue (all the time).

Ville Siren's slap<br> shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi<br> scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal<br> put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.<br> The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo<br> made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,<br> during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.<br> Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to<br> Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered<br> the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund <br> skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.<br> Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line<br> where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since<br> there was traffic in front, 4-3.<br> Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan<br> and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to<br> Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.<br> Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only<br> 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone <br> with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja<br> made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.<br> The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal<br> late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,<br> showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck<br> and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.<br> But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the<br> game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow<br> angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.<br><br> All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.<br> Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period<br> to try no combinations.<br><br> Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-<br> Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.<br> Stillman good on defense.<br> Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner<br> hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson<br> will likely have to leave for NHL pros.<br><br> Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the<br> Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him<br> a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.<br> I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team.

Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that<br>&gt;would not have been the case had Dionne kept his cool. <br>&gt;Roy stood on his <br>&gt;head for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from <br>&gt;end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by <br>&gt;Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed <br>&gt;Hextall for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall <br>&gt;the hero because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.<br><br>Whoa.  What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays<br>really well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths<br>is not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he<br>allowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you<br>should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third<br>period.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they<br>would not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular<br>goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they<br>are occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like<br>Sakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there <br>are any legitimate excuses. <br><br>&gt;Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces <br>&gt;[description of lucky bounces.....]<br>&gt;Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... <br><br>I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a<br>relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result <br>in a goal. <br><br>&gt; ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against<br>&gt;an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with<br>&gt;a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.<br><br>In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as<br>'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty<br>either...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal<br>only, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second <br>goal.<br><br>&gt;This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,<br>&gt;as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau<br>&gt;were silent. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave<br>&gt;up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.<br><br>What you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the <br>game was effectively won.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you<br>could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what<br>if's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final<br>result is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and<br>email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive<br>screwups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie<br>is the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is<br>focussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a lousy<br>goal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.<br><br>&gt;And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. <br><br>WHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally<br>unrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if<br>you're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key<br>saves at the key times.<br><br>&gt;Roy is paid big money because<br>&gt;that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5<br><br>For the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in<br>the league.  In fact, I agree that he is.<br><br>&gt;The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory<br>&gt;comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans.<br>                            <br>I assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think<br>the loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've<br>made any other 'derogatory comments'.  If you regard objective<br>(and informed, FYI) observations as derogatory, I really can't help you. <br><br>--<br>dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca<br><br><br></td><td style=\"text-align: left;vertical-align: top; width: 300px; word-break:break-all;\">**e87c5249228048ec0b69e7a85188930065fa54f9**<br>Path: cantaloupe.srv.cs.cmu.edu!magnesium.club.cc.cmu.edu!pitt.edu!gatech!howland.reston.ans.net!zaphod.mps.ohio-state.edu!cs.utexas.edu!uunet!pipex!sunic!ericom!etxonss<br>From: etxonss@ufsa.ericsson.se (Staffan Axelsson)<br>Newsgroups: rec.sport.hockey<br>Subject: WC 93: Results, April 20<br>Message-ID: &lt;1993Apr21.073134.5117@ericsson.se&gt;<br>Date: 21 Apr 93 07:31:34 GMT<br>Sender: news@ericsson.se<br>Organization: Ericsson Telecom, Stockholm, Sweden<br>Lines: 162<br>Nntp-Posting-Host: uipc104.ericsson.se<br><br><br> 1993 World Championships in Germany:<br> ====================================<br><br> Group A results:<br><br> SWEDEN - CANADA  1-4 (0-0,1-1,0-3)<br><br> 1st:<br> 2nd: CAN 0-1 Geoff Sanderson      (Kevin Dineen)                  7:24<br>      SWE 1-1 Patrik Juhlin        (Jan Larsson)                  15:23 (pp)<br> 3rd: CAN 1-2 Geoff Sanderson                                      5:54 (ps)<br>      CAN 1-3 Mike Gartner         (Greg Johnson,Adam Graves)     10:44 <br>      CAN 1-4 Rod Brind'Amour      (Shayne Corson)                19:59<br><br>            Shots on goal:    Penalties:    Attendance:     Referee:<br> Sweden     10 15 12 - 37     42min        6,500           Rob Hearn (USA)<br> Canada     10 13  6 - 29     62min<br><br> Bill Ranford stopped 36 shots to lead Canada to a 4-1 victory in a very well<br> played game.<br><br> The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and<br> Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding<br> Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom <br> played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up<br> Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge<br> to Sweden in creating more opportunities.<br> Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi<br> made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but<br> Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada<br> started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked<br> hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson<br> who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and<br> made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.<br> The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot<br> that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.<br> Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took<br> a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by<br> the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.<br> Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure<br> but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.<br> At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to<br> cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.<br> That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in <br> the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he<br> explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close<br> to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.<br> Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a<br> bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas<br> then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.<br> The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a<br> rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds<br> in the dressing room.<br><br> A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing<br> great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better<br> than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best<br> goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.<br> Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is<br> easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,<br> Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.<br><br> The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-<br> Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the<br> task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.<br> Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering<br> that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very<br> well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because<br> of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake<br> on the 1-3 goal.<br><br> Lines information follows further below.<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br><br> ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)<br><br> 1st:<br> 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47<br> 3rd:<br><br> Penalties: ITA 102min, SWI 82min<br> Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia<br> Attendance: 3,500<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br> Group B results:<br><br> CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)<br><br> 1st:<br> 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51<br>      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26<br>      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10<br> 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28<br>      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07<br><br> Penalties: CZE 72min, GER 62min 15min 110min game penalty<br> Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada<br> Attendance: 10,200<br><br> The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd<br> showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.<br><br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br><br> FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)<br><br> 1st:<br> 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00<br> 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26<br><br> Penalties: FIN 72min, USA 62min<br> Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia<br> Attendance: 2,800<br><br> I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the<br> whole game).
